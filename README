Squidegory - Make sense of your Squid access logs with a little help
from Python and Shallalist

What is in a name?
------------------
Yeah, I don't like the name Squidegory; but my first choice, Squirm,
was already taken. Feel free to send suggestions my way.

What is it exactly?
-------------------
Basically, If you do any kind of content filtering, or perhaps simply
want to get an understanding of http usage, there is little available
in the way of open source tools. If you have a decent budget there are
plenty of proprietary resources out there, but sans funds you are out
of luck. I am attempting to bridge that gap using Squid and the popular
SquidGuard blacklist, Shallalist.

What can it do?
---------------
Currently just two, albeit important, things. Squidegory uses your
access log from Squid and, with Shallalist, is able to parse and
meaningfully categorize the data. So for instance, you can get a list
of requests by category, ordered by popularity. Squidegory is also able
to give you the converse of this and list all requested sites that are
as of yet "unknown."

There is no real user interface as of yet, but I'd like to start work on
a web interface implemented using CherryPy or Twisted soon.
